        <h2><center>An unexpected result</center></h2>
        <p>The purpose of this visualisation is to try and find a relationship between the wealth of a neighbourhood and the 
          type of restaurants that are available in that region. <br><br> Here we face a few serious problems when analyszing our dataset.
          A reasonable assertion to make would be that areas with higher disposale income should have more restaurants, but here 
          Melbourne (3000) which has a relatively low weekly median income, contains most of the restaurants.
          <br><br>
          This could be due to the number of restaurants tracking more closely with overall population instead of wealth. Let us dive deeper to see if we 
          can find some other insights.

      <h2><center>A worrying trend</center></h2>
      <p> Every single restaurant category has shrunk in the past few years, but how does it impact Melbourne overall? Are all parts of Melbourne affected equally?
        <br><br>
        Now let's try to see a clearer picture of what the city looks like in 2022.

      <h2><center>Organizing the dataset</center></h2>
        <p> The chart on the left shows us not just the number of restaurants, but also the number of seats
          they hold in total across each region.<br><br> This supports the hypothesis presented earlier with restaurant numbers tracking with overall footfall more than with income <br><br> The clear problem infront of us is that the Australian 
        beareau of statistics decided not to count Cafes and restaurants in separate categories which means that we might need to analyse this dataset differently.</p>

    <div id = "stacked"></div>
    <div id = "textdetails">
      <h2><center>So what about fast food?</center></h2>
      <p> Fast food restaurants often focus on speed and affordability so does that mean there is a relationship between income and fast food
        <br><br> Based on the graph on the right a wealthy region like Kensington has nowhere near the same number of fast food joints compared to Melbourne(CBD).
        <br><br> This proves that there are definetly some other variables that are influencing where brands choose to set up shop.</p>
